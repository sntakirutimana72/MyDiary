        To start a diary, all you need is a willingness to write.
        Start by figuring out what you want to write in your journal.
        If you aren’t sure, simply start writing and see where that leads.
        It can also be useful to set a time limit in your early writing sessions.
        Set an alarm for 10 to 20 minutes and start writing.
        Keeping a diary is a great way to record your growth and personal development.
        More entries will allow you to look back and see what has changed over time.
        The earlier you start, the more grateful you will be later on.
